			<h3>About Wrevel:</h3>
			<p>Welcome to Wrevel. Wrevel, Inc. ("Wrevel", "we", "us" and/or "our") enables people all over the world to plan, promote, and sell tickets to any event. Wrevel also enables people to socialize and attend different types of themed events.  And we make it easy for everyone to discover events, and to share the events they are attending with the people they know. We do this through our websites and domains, the services available on or through our websites and domains or otherwise provided by us, and the software available on or through our websites and domains or otherwise provided by us.</p>
			
			</br>
			
			<h3>Our Policy:</h3>
			<p>This Privacy Policy sets forth our policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable information ("Personal Data"), that is collected from users of and/or visitors to the Services (including through those users' and visitors' agents) ("you" or "your"), including (i) registered users who are event organizers, planners and charitable organizations ("Organizers"), (ii) users who want to purchase tickets to, register for or donate to events (whether free or paid) listed by Organizers on the Services ("Buyers"), and (iii) other non-Organizer users or visitors to the Services ("other non-Organizers").</p>
			<p>We take the privacy of your Personal Data and other information seriously. Because of that, we have created this Privacy Policy. Please read this Privacy Policy as it includes important information regarding your Personal Data and other information.</p>
			<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us by emailing us at <span style="text-decoration:underline;color:blue;">support@wrevel.com</span>.</p>
			
			
			<h4>Consent:</h4>
			<p>By using the Services or allowing someone to use the Services on your behalf, you are consenting to our collection, use, disclosure, transfer and storage in accordance with this Privacy Policy of any Personal Data or other information received by us as a result of such use.</p>
			
			</br>
			
			<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
			<p>When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>
			<h4>1.Personal Data:</h4>
			<p>Organizers: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information to the Services, such as when you register for access to the Services as an Organizer, contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys or use certain Services. The Personal Data we may collect includes without limitation your name, address, email address and other personally identifiable information. In some cases we may collect your credit card information (e.g., your credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc.), some of which may constitute Personal Data, to secure certain payments. In addition, if you use our payment processing services, we will collect financial information from you (e.g., your bank account information or an address to send checks) as necessary to facilitate payments and information required for tax purposes (e.g., your taxpayer identification number).</p>
			<p>Buyers and other non-Organizers: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information to the Services (including event registration pages within the Services), such as when you register for access to the Services (whether as an Organizer or otherwise), register for an event as a Buyer, contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys or use certain parts of the Services. The  Personal Data we may collect includes without limitation your name, address, email address, zip code and other personally identifiable information. If you register for a paid event, we will collect financial information from you (e.g., your credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc.) some of which may constitute Personal Data. In addition, Organizers can set up event registration pages to collect virtually any information from Buyers in connection with registration for an Organizer&rsquo;s event listed on the Services. If a Buyer voluntarily provides that information in connection with registration for an event or otherwise, it will be available to us and will be held by us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In addition, such information will be delivered to the Organizer of the applicable event in accordance with "Our Disclosure of Information That We Collect: Organizers" below.</p>
			<p>Privacy Policy Links: We make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy in the footer of every page on our websites, including those pages on which Personal Data is collected, and to make it available in all of our software.</p>
			</br>
			
			<h4>2. Non-Personal Data:</h4>
			<p>Non-Identifiable Data: When you interact with the Services, we collect certain personally non-identifiable information ("Non-Personal Data"). The Non-Personal Data we collect includes without limitation Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, Internet browser type, other characteristics of your device and software, domain names of your Internet Service Provider, your approximate geographic location, a record of your usage of the Services, the time of your usage and aggregated Personal Data that cannot be used to specifically identify you. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot, in and of itself, be used to specifically identify you. We also collect Non-Personal Data (including, without limitation, of the type set forth above) from third parties. The information we collect from third parties may be combined with the information we collect.</p>
			<p>Aggregated Personal Data: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, we often conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Data and other information that we have collected. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis and this aggregate information does not identify you personally and therefore is considered and treated as Non-Personal Data under this Privacy Policy.</p>
			</br>
			
			<h4>3. Cookies, Pixels Tags, Local Shared Objects, Web Storage and Similar Technologies:</h4>
			<p>Please refer to our Cookie Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this Privacy Policy, for 
more information about our use of these technologies.</p>
			</br>
			
			<h3>Our Use of Information That We Collect:</h3>
			
			<h4>1.Personal Data:</h4>
			<p>We use the Personal Data we collect in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may use the Personal Data as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Specific Reason: If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem and will respond to the email address from which the contact came.</li>
				<li>Access and Use: If you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to or use of the Services or any functionality thereof, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to or use of the Services or functionality and to monitor your use of such Services or functionality. For instance, if you supply payment information (e.g., bank account or credit card information) to the Services for the purpose of purchasing tickets as a Buyer or processing payments as an Organizer, we will use that information to facilitate such purchase or process such payments.</li>
				<li>Internal Business Purposes: We may use your Personal Data for internal business purposes including without limitation to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users, to improve the Services, to protect against, identify or address wrongdoing, to enforce our Terms of Service, to manage your account and provide you with customer service, and to generally manage the Services and our business.</li>
				<li>Marketing: We may use your Personal Data to contact you in the future for our marketing and advertising purposes, including without limitation to inform you about services or events we believe might be of interest to you, to develop promotional or marketing materials and provide those materials to you, and to display content and advertising on or off the Services that we believe might be of relevance to you. In particular, Organizers should note that we may use information we receive or collect regarding Buyers (including without limitation via an Organizer&rsquo;s event registration page) in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, including in the manner set forth above.</li>
				<li>Organizer Emails: We allow Organizers to use our email system to contact Buyers for their current and past events, so you may receive emails from our system that originate with such Organizers.</li>				
			</ul>
			<p>If we intend to use any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected or we will obtain your consent subsequent to such collection but prior to such use.</p>
			
			<h4>2. Non-Personal Data:</h4>
			<p>Because Non-Personal Data cannot be used to personally identify you, we may use such information for any lawful purpose.</p>
			
			
			</br>
			
			<h3>Our Disclosure of Information That We Collect:</h3>
			
			<h4>1.Personal Data:</h4>
			<p>We are not in the business of selling your Personal Data. We consider this information to be vital part of our relationship with you. Therefore, we will not sell your Personal Data to third parties, including third party advertisers. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may disclose, transfer or share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</p>

			<p>Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets. You acknowledge and agree that any successor to or acquirer of Wrevel (or its assets) will continue to have the right to use your Personal Data and other information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<p>Subsidiaries and Affiliates: We may also share your Personal Data with our subsidiaries and/or affiliates for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. Our subsidiaries and affiliates will be bound to maintain that Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
			<p>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: We, like many businesses, sometimes engage other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, ticket fulfillment, fraud prevention, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we engage another company to perform such functions, we may provide them with information, including Personal Data, in connection with their performance of such functions.</p>
			<p>Organizers: When you purchase tickets to, register for or donate to an event or related fundraising page on the Services, you consent to our providing your Personal Data to the Organizers of such event and related fundraising page, if applicable. For fundraising pages we may provide your personal information both to the Organizer charity of the fundraising page and the Organizer of the event to which the fundraising page is linked. These Organizers are not bound to treat your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You agree that we are not responsible for the actions of these Organizers with respect to your Personal Data. It is important that you review the applicable policies of the Organizers of an event (and the related fundraising page, if applicable) before providing Personal Data or other information in connection with that event or related fundraising page.</p>
			<p>Facebook and Other Third Party Connections: You can connect your Wrevel account to your accounts on third party services like Facebook, in which case we may collect, use, disclose, transfer and store information relating to your account with such third party services in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For example, if you connect with Facebook, we store your Facebook id, first name, last name, email, location, friends list and profile picture and use them to connect with your Facebook account to provide certain functionality on the Services, like recommending events that your Facebook friends are interested in and sharing the events you are interested in with certain groups of people like your Facebook friends.</p>
			<p>Legal Requirements: We may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law (including, without limitation responding to a subpoena or request from law enforcement, court or government agency) or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary (i) to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) to protect or defend our rights, interests or property or that of third parties, (iii) to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Services, (iv) to act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (v) to protect against legal liability.</p>
			
			<h4>2. Non-Personal Data:</h4>
			<p>Because Non-Personal Data cannot be used to personally identify you, we may disclose, transfer or share Non-Personal Data for any lawful purpose.</p>
			
			<h3>Your Choices:</h3>
			<p>You have several choices available when it comes to your Personal Data:</p>
			<p>Limit the Personal Data You Provide: You can use the Services without providing any Personal Data or with limiting the Personal Data you provide. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data or limit the Personal Data you provide, you may not be able to use certain functionality of the Services. For instance, in order to open an account, or buy or sell tickets, your name and email address will be required.</p>
			<p>Opt Out: You can e-mail us at <span style="color:blue;text-decoration:underline;">support@wrevel.com</span> if you want to opt out and cancel your account.</p>

			<h4>Links to Other Web Sites:</h4>
			<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by us (the "Third Party Sites").

			<p>The Services and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for us to make changes to this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time (collectively, "Modifications").
