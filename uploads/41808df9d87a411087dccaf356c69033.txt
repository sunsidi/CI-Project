My family follows many values of the state. My parents has always told me to respect everyone no matter who they are. If you want respect from others you must first respect them. They also expected me to respect them the same way no matter what and taught me how to behave around my relatives. You should greet them at the door, don't touch everything inside the house, say thank you and please when necessary, and a bunch of other stuff. This is similar to filial piety of Confucian philosophy.

An example of when my family goes against the values of the state is during the time of holidays. Sure my family celebrates and gets together on christmas, new years, thanksgiving, and all those other holidays, but we don't enforce the unwritten rules of gift giving. My parents were on a low budget and I understood that buying gifts every holiday would be very hard for my parents.
In addition, my family goes against the values of consumer culture. We don't buy everything we see that is on sale. They only time we ever buy stuff is when things cannot be used anymore. We have furniture, clocks, equipment, etc that have been in the house for 15 years. They still work so there is no reason to replace them. There is an exception however, when it comes to clothing. For clothing, we only buy clothing when its on sale. This ofcourse may be due to our low budget but it still goes against the values of consumer culture.
